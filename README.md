# Linkd
Linkd is an Android app designed to connect two or more users to the same virtual drawing pad, enabling seamless collaboration in real time.

The idea for this app came from a personal challenge. While helping my daughter with her homework remotely, I found it frustrating that I couldnâ€™t easily share the sketches I was making on my e-ink tablet. It felt cumbersome to convey concepts without a shared space to draw and interact.

With Linkd, I aim to simplify this process. The app connects our devices, allowing us to draw and interact in turn, making remote collaboration much smoother and more intuitive.
